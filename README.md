## Installing Node.js and NPM
You need a working installation of Node.js and NPM (which comes with Node.js) on your machine. Installation instructions for Node.js can be found at https://nodejs.org.

The versions that I used while building this workshop are v11.3.0 for Node.js and 6.4.1 for NPM. After installing Node.js you can run `node -v` and `npm -v` to check if both Node.js and NPM are working, and which versions you have installed.

## Preparing VS Code
Install the following extensions:
- ESLint by Dirk Baeumer
- Veture by Pine Wu

The extensions are not strictly necessary but make working with Vue.js really easy.

*Remember to restart VS Code after installing the extensions.*

## Preparing Chrome
Install the following extensions:
- Vue.js devtools (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd)
